A stateful component class defines a function that calls this.setState. (Parent.js, lines 15-19)

The stateful component passes that function down to a stateless component. (Parent.js, line 24)

That stateless component class defines a function that calls the passed-down function, 
and that can take an event object as an argument. (Child.js, lines 10-13)

The stateless component class uses this new function as an event handler. (Child.js, line 20)

When an event is detected, the parentâ€™s state updates. (A user selects a new dropdown menu item)

The stateful component class passes down its state, distinct from the ability to change its state, 
to a different stateless component. (Parent.js, line 25)

That stateless component class receives the state and displays it. (Sibling.js, lines 5-10)

An instance of the stateful component class is rendered. One stateless child component displays the state, 
and a different stateless child component displays a way to change the state. (Parent.js, lines 23-26)
